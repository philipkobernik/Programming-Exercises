Programming Exercises

My own solutions to classic programming problems, along with tests for each solution

Binary search
	*	Traditional incremental method
	*	Recursive method
	
Sort
	*	Selection sort (relatively dumb ;)
	
Run the tests by typing 'ruby binary_search_test.rb' (or sort_test.rb) after navigating to the directory in your terminal
